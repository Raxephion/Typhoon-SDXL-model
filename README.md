# üå©Ô∏è Typhoon (SDXL)

> **üì¢ Welcome to Typhoon SDXL ‚Äî a stylized, cinematic model built for clarity, precision, and the occasional artful overkill.**  
> This is *not* a raw realism model. It‚Äôs got opinions. Strong ones.

## üß† About

Typhoon SDXL began as a planned sequel to Tornado ‚Äî but things escalated. What started as *Tornado v3* took on its own identity, eventually diverging into a standalone model with a distinct, stylized realism that balances cinematic lighting, visual depth, and highly clean detail.

This model was built from the ground up using:
- ‚úÖ Full SDXL 1.0 training (not a merge)
- ‚úÖ Clean, curated datasets with subject + lighting emphasis
- ‚úÖ A suite of custom-trained LoRAs selectively merged back in
- ‚úÖ Manual tuning using merge weighting, style balancing, and‚Ä¶ trial-by-GPU-failure

> Fun fact: 1 out of every 4 training runs failed. So yes, your prompts aren‚Äôt the only thing that gets unstable.

## üå™Ô∏è What Makes Typhoon SDXL Different?

- **Stylized Precision:** Default outputs are vivid, high-detail, and slightly polished ‚Äî favoring ‚Äúclean realism‚Äù over documentary grit.
- **Portrait-Grade Quality:** Close-ups are sharp, defined, and don‚Äôt need Adetailer.
- **Cinematic Depth & Lighting:** Reworked light behavior gives more drama per pixel.
- **Prompt Simplicity:** No trigger words. Just describe what you want. Seriously.

Expect strong highlights, bold lighting, high-contrast renders, and an aesthetic that sits halfway between real-world and a concept art board.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It *can* do raw realism ‚Äî but it won‚Äôt default there. You‚Äôll have to nudge it.

| Default Aesthetic     | ‚ÄúRendered real‚Äù ‚Äì clean, vivid, cinematic realism                     |
| Close-up Performance  | Excellent ‚Äì no Adetailer needed                                       |
| Lighting & Composition| Enhanced depth, strong shadows, balanced contrast                     |
| Prompting Style       | Natural language and/or tag-based ‚Äî both work well                    |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Recommended Settings

These were tested on Forge WebUI, but should translate well to most SDXL interfaces.

- **CFG Scale:** `0.3 ‚Äì 0.8`  
  > Sweet spot seems to be `0.5 ‚Äì 0.7` depending on lighting and scene complexity

- **Sampler:**  
  - `DPM++ 2M Karras` (ü•á recommended)  
  - `Euler`, `Euler A`  
  - `DPM++ SDE`  
  - Most usual suspects work fine

- **Steps:** `15+`  
  > More steps = more detail, but diminishing returns after 30-ish

- **Face Restoration:**  
  > ‚ùå Disable it. Especially for close-ups ‚Äî it muddies the eyes.

- **Prompting:**  
  - Descriptive sentence-style prompts are highly effective  
  - Tag-style also works, especially for concept art or fantasy styles

---

## ‚ú® Style Fit

Typhoon SDXL works best for:
- Portraits and close-ups
- Cinematic compositions
- Soft realism and fantasy realism
- Stylized concept art and clean render-style scenes

You‚Äôll get bold visuals with depth, rich lighting, and smooth but defined surface detail.

## üì∑ Sample Output

All images generated **natively** using Typhoon SDXL without external LoRAs, inpainting, or fixers. What you see is pure model output.

<table> <tr> <td><img src="./images/typhoonxl_0001.png" width="160"/></td> <td><img src="./images/typhoonxl_0002.png" width="160"/></td> <td><img src="./images/typhoonxl_0003.png" width="160"/></td> <td><img src="./images/typhoonxl_0004.png" width="160"/></td> <td><img src="./images/typhoonxl_0005.png" width="160"/></td> </tr> </table>

## üõ†Ô∏è Behind The Storm

Building Typhoon SDXL was not a straight line. The process involved:

1. **Base Checkpoint Training** ‚Äî Starting from clean SDXL 1.0
2. **Targeted LoRA Development** ‚Äî Custom LoRAs were trained for lighting, facial detail, anatomy, and style
3. **Manual Merge Tuning** ‚Äî Each LoRA was merged back via experimental merge weights + scaling
4. **Hand Calibration** ‚Äî This wasn‚Äôt a ComfyUI pipeline ‚Äî merge order and value tweaks were done manually.

Also developed during the process:

- [`LoRA Strength Analyzer`](https://github.com/Raxephion/loRA-Strength-Analyser) ‚Äî Get math-backed advice on LoRA merge weights
- [`LoRA Epoch Analyzer`](https://github.com/Raxephion/loRA-Epoch-Analyser) ‚Äî Find which epoch actually did the work

Both tools are in alpha and being wrapped into a Gradio UI soon‚Ñ¢.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- NSFW output is **very inconsistent** ‚Äî some recovery work has been done, but YMMV
- Default aesthetic leans ‚Äústylized-real‚Äù ‚Äî gritty realism must be forced
- High-gloss lighting can over-emphasize skin or fabric unless balanced
- Like all SDXL models, heavy prompting can still cause drift if poorly structured

---

## üö´ Usage Restrictions

This model is released under a modified CreativeML Open RAIL-M license:

- ‚úÖ Personal, local use is encouraged.
- ‚ùå **Do not merge** with other models ‚Äî Typhoon‚Äôs internal balance will break.
- ‚ùå **Do not upload** to public generation sites, bots, or APIs.

> Basically: use it, don‚Äôt abuse it. Keep the storm local.
