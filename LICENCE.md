## 🔒 Additional Usage Conditions

1. This model is intended for **personal, private use only**.
2. Do **not** upload this model to third-party image generation services, public inference sites, or commercial platforms **without express permission**.
3. **Do not merge** this model with other checkpoints or LoRAs.  
   - It’s delicate. Like a soufflé. Merging breaks its carefully tuned aesthetic.
4. Redistribution (modified or not, partial or full) is **strictly prohibited** unless you’ve spoken to me first.
5. Do not use Typhoon to create derivative models, embeds, fine-tunes, or LoRAs — **without direct approval**.

That means:
